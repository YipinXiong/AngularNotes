# Basic Syntax

- `*ngFor`
- `*ngIf`
- Interpolation `{{ }}`
- Property binding `[ ]`
- Event binding `( )`



# Components

A component consists of three things:

- **A component class** that handles data and functionality. In the previous section, the product data and the `share()` method in the component class handle data and functionality, respectively.
- **An HTML template** that determines the UI. In the previous section, the product list's HTML template displays the name, description, and a "Share" button for each product.
- **Component-specific styles** that define the look and feel. Though product list does not define any styles, this is where component CSS resides.

> The most different part from React is that components in Angular are more like "MVC"



## Input

Parent components pass their information to child components via `property`



```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Input } from '@angular/core';
export class ProductAlertsComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() product;
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

}
```

## Output

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Input } from '@angular/core';
import { Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
export class ProductAlertsComponent {
  @Input() product;
  @Output() notify = new EventEmitter();
}
```





# Routing

## Register URLs

The meta file is `app.module.ts`. Thus, the very first thing is to register the url.

```typescript
//src/app/app.module.ts

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      { path: '', component: ProductListComponent },
      { path: 'products/:productId', component: ProductDetailsComponent },
    ])
  ],
```



```html
<div *ngFor="let product of products; index as productId">

  <h3>
    <a [title]="product.name + ' details'" [routerLink]="['/products', productId]">
      {{ product.name }}
    </a>
  </h3>
<!-- . . . -->
</div>
```



## Using route info

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { products } from '../products';

export class ProductDetailsComponent implements OnInit {
  product;

  constructor(
  //dependency injection?
    private route: ActivatedRoute,
  ) { }
  
  /* 
  	In the ngOnInit() method, subscribe to route params and fetch the product based 		on the productId. Angular calls ngOnInit() shortly after creating a component. 
  */
  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
      this.product = products[+params.get('productId')];
    });
  }
}

```







# Services

## Introduction 

Services are an integral part of Angular applications. In Angular, a service is an instance of a class that can be made available to any part of your application using Angular's [dependency injection system](https://angular.io/guide/glossary#dependency-injection-di).

```typescript
//instance

export class ProductDetailsComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(
    private route: ActivatedRoute,
    private cartService: CartService
  ) { }
}
```

Services are the place where you share data between parts of your application. For the online store, the cart service is where you store your cart data and methods.

[Introduction to services and dependency injection](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services#introduction-to-services-and-dependency-injection)

## Motivation

Angular distinguishes components from services to **increase modularity and reusability** by separating a component's view-related functionality from other kinds of processing. A component can delegate certain tasks to services, such as fetching data from the server, validating user input, or logging directly to the console. By defining such processing tasks in an *injectable service class*, you make those tasks available to any component. You can also make your app more adaptable by injecting different providers of the same kind of service, as appropriate in different circumstances.

# Self-relfection

In Angualr, it uses `directives` to change the default behaviors of html tags.
